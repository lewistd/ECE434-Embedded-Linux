Trey Lewis      ECE 434

Homework 7 items:

	Project:

		The Project Template was copied and updated with my project information. The title of the wiki page is 'ECE497 Project -
		Android App to Speaker'. The wiki was also added to the Category:ECE497 so that it can be easily found. The page was 
		updated with info that we have so far, including the Executive Summary.

	Blynk:

		I was able to successfully download the Blynk application on my phone, get my Auth token, and run the sample exercise
		(./leds.js), which on the app had a virtual  button that while held turned on the USR3 led. There was also a button
		attached to P9_15 on the bone that when pressed turned on a virtual led in the app. Both of these functions worked as
		expected.

	A slider:

		I added a virtual slider to my project in the Blynk app, and connected an led to P9_14 on the bone. I added the
		functionality to the leds.js program to control the brightness of the led on P9_14 with the virtual slider in the app.
		This function worked successfully and I also demoed it along with the functionality from the sample exercise in the
		Blynk section above. To run the program, simply type the command './leds.js' in the terminal window and run the
		project in the Blynk app. I will assume that the correct Auth token is being used. Now, the bone and Blynk app should
		be connected and all of the functions of the program can be utilized.
