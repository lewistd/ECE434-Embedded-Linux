	Logging in Sheets:

		I chose the two temperature sensors from an earlier homework assignment to monitor. I have the time noted for each read
		along with the reading from sensors 1 and 2 plotted in 30 second intervals. I monitored for about 25 minutes. I did a 
		few things to the sensors while tracking, including placing my finger on one of them, covering them in a blanket, 
		blowing cold air from a fan on them, and placing my finger on both of them, as well as let them sit at room temp. Can
		you tell from the plot where each of these events happened. I was able to make out the distinctions in the plot.
		Run the program with the command "./demo.js". It will run forever plotting every 30 seconds. Enter Ctrl+C to quit.
